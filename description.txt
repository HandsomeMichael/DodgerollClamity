Jonasue's Dodgeroll Mod but now with calamity stuff

Original Mod by Jonasue, go see the original mod if you want a lightweight , balanced and more configurable dodgeroll.
Im too lazy to patch the mod so i just fork it.

You can use the mod without calamity, althought some feature is disabled.

Changes :

- Dodging grant bonuses depending on held weapon and timing ( perfect dodge )
- Some accesories grant more dodging bonuses or dodging capability
- Adrenaline & Rage grant stat increase on dodgeroll
- Rolling depletes most curable debuff faster
- Rolling halfs fall damage, perfect roll prevent death from fall damage
- Now should work with multiplayer
- Dodge sound effects ig
- Removed some configs
