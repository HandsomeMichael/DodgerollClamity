things i wanna do :

-- ui redesign
-- succesfully dodging attack grant buff based on held weapon
-- dodging while in infinite adrenaline stamina will only trigger life regen bonus
>> grant full stealth on rogue 
>> grant increased attack speed on ranged
>> grant mana regen and damage increase on magic
>> grant defense and movement speed on summoner
>> grant strength on melee or other typeless weapon
>> grant life regen if player in a critical condition
>>>> grant fast reload if CalamityOverhaul is enabled on guns otherwise regular ranged (cant due to i really dont understand this chineese documentation dawg)

-- dodgeroll multiplayer fix

- rage increases dodgeroll stamina regen
- adrenaline grants infinite stamina but right after dodging you take 5% more damage for 3 seconds

- dodgeroll accesories :
> increase dodgeroll length
> increase dodgeroll stamina regen
